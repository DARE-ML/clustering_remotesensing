## A comparative study of clustering methods for hyperspectral data processing

This repository provides supplementary materials for the paper entitled 'A comparative study of clustering methods for hyperspectral data processing'. This paper compares the efficiency of different clustering methods including K-means, MiniBatch K-means, Bisecting K-means, BIRCH, Agglomerative Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture for processing a well-known hyperspectral dataset, i.e., Indian Pines.
